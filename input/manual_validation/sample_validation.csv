This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01953510. Methods: In this single-blind, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial, infants aged 2 months were recruited by community health staff in districts 4 and 7 of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Eligible infants had no clinically significant maternal or prenatal history and were born at or after 36 weeks' gestation. Participants were randomly assigned (3:3:5:4:5:4) using block randomisation, stratified by district, to one of six PCV10 or PCV13 vaccination schedules. Here we report results for four groups: group A, who were given PCV10 at ages 2, 3, 4, and 9 months (a 3 + 1 schedule); group B, who were vaccinated at ages 2, 3, and 4 months (3 + 0 schedule); group C, who were vaccinated at ages 2, 4, and 9·5 months (2 + 1 schedule); and group D, who were vaccinated at ages 2 and 6 months (two-dose schedule). Laboratory-based assessors were masked to group allocation. Blood samples were collected at different prespecified timepoints between ages 3–18 months depending on group allocation, within 27–43 days after vaccination, and these were analysed for serotype-specific IgG and opsonophagocytic responses. Participants were followed-up until age 24 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of infants with serotype-specific IgG levels of 0·35 μg/mL or higher at age 5 months, analysed as a non-inferiority comparison (10% margin) of the two-dose and three-dose primary series (group C vs groups A and B combined). We also compared responses 4 weeks after two doses administered at either ages 2 and 4 months (group C) or at ages 2 and 6 months (group D). The primary endpoint was analysed in the per-protocol population. Reactogenicity has been reported previously.

The study was done at Q-Pharm (Brisbane, QLD, Australia) following approval by the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute Human Research Ethics Committee. All participants gave written informed consent before enrolment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03261401). Methods: This first-in-human study was a two-part, single-centre clinical trial done in Brisbane, QLD, Australia. Part one was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study in which participants were enrolled into one of nine dose cohorts (50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 1000, 1250, 1800, or 2100 mg) and randomly assigned (3:1) to M5717 or placebo. A sentinel dosing strategy was used for each dose cohort whereby two participants (one assigned to M5717 and one assigned to placebo) were initially randomised and dosed. Randomisation schedules were generated electronically by independent, unblinded statisticians. Part two was an open-label, non-randomised volunteer infection study using the Plasmodium falciparum induced blood-stage malaria model in which participants were enrolled into three dose cohorts. Healthy men and women of non-childbearing potential aged 18–55 years were eligible for inclusion; individuals in the volunteer infection study were required to be malaria naive. Safety and tolerability (primary outcome of the single ascending dose study and secondary outcome of the volunteer infection study) were assessed by frequency and severity of adverse events. The pharmacokinetic profile of M5717 was also characterised (primary outcome of the volunteer infection study and secondary outcome of the single ascending dose study). Parasite clearance kinetics (primary outcome of the volunteer infection study) were assessed by the parasite reduction ratio and the corresponding parasite clearance half-life; the incidence of recrudescence up to day 28 was determined (secondary outcome of the volunteer infection study). Recrudescent parasites were tested for genetic mutations (exploratory outcome). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03261401).","",TRUE,2021,"",""
